# Contributing

First, Thank you for considering helping. I am glad this project means that much to you as it does to me. It needs a lot of improvement.

## First Step

If you've noticed something wrong or just want to deep dive or have an idea, just open an [issue](https://github.com/LeonnardoVerol/Programming-Languages-Syntax-Reference/issues)! Lets talk about it. There are many ways to contribute, from improving the documentation to adding new syntax.

It's generally best before you do anything to open an [issue](https://github.com/LeonnardoVerol/Programming-Languages-Syntax-Reference/issues). This way we can avoid multiple people doing the same thing.

## Current Avaliable Syntax

- Programming Languages
  - C
  - C++ (Cpp)
  - C# (Csharp)
  - Java
  - Rust
  - Go
  - Javascript
  - TypeScript
  - Python

## New Syntax Group

Be my guest.

## New Languages

Be my guest.

## Any Language?

Well.. maybe not dead ones? But if you believe thats important, just open an [issue](https://github.com/LeonnardoVerol/Programming-Languages-Syntax-Reference/issues) to coordinate its inclusion.

## Where?

All the "code" is stored on Github in Markdown files.

At the end of this file, you can find a [Code Block Sample](#code-block-sample) for Programming Languages Syntax.

## Coding Conventions

- Whenever possible, try to follow the language guidelines (variable naming, function naming and so on)
- Indent using `tabs`
- Be Obvious and redundant (No implicit cast, explicit `this.` operator etc)

## Web Support

For Web Support, we use [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).

Everything is _automagically_ converted from the Github repository.

The sidebar is the only feature that needs to be maintained apart. (located inside `.vuepress` folder)

More info about the sidebar at the [Official Docs | Sidebar](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/theme/default-theme-config.html#sidebar) or you can just check the file.

## Web Support Known Issues

The core VuePress Markdown library responsible for creating the headers anchor links is faulty, non compliance with github nor any other parser or library I know. Avoid special character in headers level 2+ and duplicated headers in the same page.

## Code of Conduct

Please make sure you are welcoming and friendly in all of our spaces.

## Code Block Sample

Copy in Raw Markdown and adapt header level accordingly.
