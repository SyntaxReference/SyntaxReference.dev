# Contributing

___

First, Thank you for considering helping. I am glad this project means that much to you as it does to me.

## First Step

If you've noticed something wrong or just want to deep dive or have an idea, just open an issue! Lets talk about it. There are many ways to contribute, from improving the documentation to adding new languages syntax.

It's generally best before you do anything to open an issue. This way we can avoid multiple people doing the same thing.
