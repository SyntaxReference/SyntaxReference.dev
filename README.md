# Syntax Reference

:construction: This project is a working in progress in early stage :construction:

## Introduction

We often need to maintain or develop projects in specific languages. It is easy to get the syntax mixed or not remember something specific.

This reference guide is focused on simplicity rather than deep explaining. This is not a language tutorial. It is expected from the reader experience in at least one language.

If you wanna help, see [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).
